# Soybean
## Thesis repository


This repository contains the code used to generate the results of the soybean yield prediction thesis.


Data Download and Processing: 

Most of the data download, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preprocessing are performed in R. These scripts are located in the "R - part data Pre model pipeline" directory.

Modeling: 
The modeling is done in Python and is located in the "Git_pipeline" script.

Nonetheless the code has been subject to experimentation and future updates in terms of structure and efficiency can be expected.
